#Maintained by: RehabMan for: Intel DH67xx

#
# Use this patch specifically to change the layout-id 
# of the ALC892 audio device for patched AppleHDA.kext
# on Lion.
#
# Lion is different from ML in that AppleHDA.kext uses
# a different layout-id.
#

# Note: This is only for Multibeast, not used anymore in this project.
